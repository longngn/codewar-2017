However, a major factor restricting the utilization of such crops in animal nutrition is the presence of a diverse array of toxic substances capable of inducing effects ranging from loss of hair and wool to severe neurological disorders and even death. Significant advances have been made in recent years to establish the nature of these compounds and to assess their effects in animals and man. As in other branches of biomedical research, these developments have been achieved through the multidisciplinary efforts of chemists, biochemists, toxicologists, nutritionists and molecular geneticists. This volume reviews current knowledge of toxic substances in crop plants with particular reference to their anti-nutritional effects in animals and man and the potential for detoxification. The distribution and ecological significance of these compounds is also addressed.","subject_ids":["professional_technical_engineering_general","professional_technical_professional_science_agricultur_aaaa9","professional_technical_professional_science_biological_aaaa3","science_agricultural_sciences_crop_science","science_agricultural_sciences_food_science","science_biological_sciences_biochemistry","science_biological_sciences_biology_general","science_general_aaaa0"]}],"index_searched":"isbn"},"9781855737945":{"data":[{"dewey_normal":"620","title_long":"","lcc_number":"","edition_info":"Hardcover; 1996-01","publisher_id":"woodhead_publishing_ltd_a01","author_data":[],"book_id":"natural_antioxidants_and_food_quality_in_atherosclerosis_a01","physical_description_text":"450 pages","notes":"","language":"","publisher_text":"Woodhead Publishing Ltd","isbn13":"9781855737945","publisher_name":"Woodhead Publishing Ltd","urls_text":"","awards_text":"","dewey_decimal":"620","isbn10":"1855737949","marc_enc_level":"~","title_latin":"Natural Antioxidants and Food Quality in Atherosclerosis and Cancer Prevention","title":"Natural Antioxidants and Food Quality in Atherosclerosis and Cancer Prevention","summary":"","subject_ids":["health_mind_body_alternative_medicine_supplements","health_mind_body_nutrition_antioxidants_phytochemicals","health_mind_body_nutrition_general","health_mind_body_general","medicine_internal_medicine_oncology_general","medicine_special_topics_nutrition","professional_technical_engineering_industrial_manufact_aaaa9","professional_technical_engineering_general","professional_technical_medical_basic_sciences_nutrition","professional_technical_medical_medicine_internal_medicine_on","professional_technical_professional_science_agricultur_aaaa3","science_agricultural_sciences_food_science","science_general_aaaa0"]}],"index_searched":"isbn"},"9780953194988":{"index_searched":"isbn","data":[{"isbn13":"9780953194988","urls_text":"","publisher_name":"Oily Press","dewey_decimal":"572.57","awards_text":"","isbn10":"0953194981","marc_enc_level":"~","title_latin":"Lipid oxidation","title":"Lipid oxidation","summary":"In his definitive book on lipid oxidation, Professor Frankel's main objective is to develop the background necessary for a better understanding of what factors should be considered, and what methods and lipid systems should be employed, to achieve suitable evaluation and control of lipid oxidation and rancidity in complex foods, biological systems and disease states.

It is a fascinating, multi-disciplinary subject, linking the physico-chemical nature of the encapsulant with the end-use and desired properties of the materials to be 'released'. Recent years have seen a growing intensity in the development and application of encapsulation techniques and this book gives an insight into the more important application areas, such as drugs, agrochemicals, flavours, fragrances, the safe handling of materials, and protection of materials from adverse external effects. Encapsulation and Controlled Release combines basic information on the subject with details of the latest research, making it suitable for both newcomers to the field and those with experience of encapsulation technology. It will be of great interest to those working on water-soluble or dispersible polymers, as well as application chemists and biochemists in diverse areas.","subject_ids":["professional_technical_engineering_chemical_general","professional_technical_engineering_general","science_agricultural_sciences_food_science","science_general_aaaa0"]}],"index_searched":"isbn"},"9780444411990":{"data":[{"title":"Non-agricultural applications of soil surveys","subject_ids":["soil_surveys","soil_mechanics","land_use"],"summary":"","awards_text":"","dewey_decimal":"","urls_text":"","publisher_name":"Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co","isbn13":"9780444411990","title_latin":"Non-agricultural applications of soil surveys","marc_enc_level":"","isbn10":"0444411992","language":"eng","publisher_text":"Amsterdam, Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co., 1974.","publisher_id":"elsevier_scientific_publis_a01","edition_info":"","lcc_number":"S591","title_long":"","dewey_normal":"0","notes":"\"Reprinted from Geoderma vol. 10, no. 1/2.\"\n\nIncludes bibliographies.","physical_description_text":"viii, 178 p. illus. 23 cm.","book_id":"non_agricultural_applications_of_soil_surveys","author_data":[{"name":"Simonson, Roy Walter","id":"simonson_roy_walter"}]}],"index_searched":"isbn"},"9781558606883":{"data":[{"subject_ids":["computer_programming"],"summary":"","title":"Your wish is my command","isbn10":"1558606882","marc_enc_level":"","title_latin":"Your wish is my command","awards_text":"","dewey_decimal":"005.2","isbn13":"9781558606883","urls_text":"","publisher_name":"Morgan Kaufmann Publishers","publisher_text":"San Francisco : Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, 2001.","language":"eng","book_id":"your_wish_is_my_command","notes":"Includes bibliographical references and index.","physical_description_text":"xviii, 416 p. : ill. ;

Applications range from basic safety to numerous emerging applications such as those related to agrochemical residues, degradation in processing and geographical origin. The contents are carefully organized for easy access, supplemented with extensive quantitative data in convenient tables, and supported with thousands of references from the international food science literature.
